          <h3>List of ingredients</h3>
          <p>6" Imperial</p>
          <ul>
            <li>16 oz (2 blocks) cream cheese, softened @ room temp</li>
            <li>150g (3/4 cup) sugar</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup (240mL) cream, room temp</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp fine sea salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>18g (~2 tbsp) all-purpose flour</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Instructions</h3>
          <p>Make Batter</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Pre-heat oven to 475F with rack in upper third of the oven. Line a
              6”x3” (15 cm x 7.5 cm) or 8”x3” (20 cm x 7.5 cm) cake pan with two
              sheets of parchment paper. 3. Add cream cheese to a large mixing
              bowl. Mix on medium until soft and fluffy. Add in sugar. Mix until
              sugar is fully dissolved into the cheese, about 2-3 minutes.
              Scrape bowl halfway through. 4. Add eggs one at a time, beating
              until each egg is combined before adding the next one. Scrape bowl
              halfway through. 5. Add salt and vanilla extract. Mix on low to
              combine. With mixer still running, slowly stream in cream. Mix in
              cream until batter is smooth. 6. Sift in all-purpose flour. Fold
              flour into batter until combined. Scrape down the bowl in the
              process. Add Flavour (optional) 1. Divide batter into 3 portions,
              one larger (leave plain), one medium (moderate flavour/colour),
              one slightly smaller (most saturated/concentrated). 2. If using
              matcha or cocoa powder, add powder to a large bowl. Alternate
              between adding splashes of cream and whisking vigorously. Keep
              whisking until a smooth moderately thick paste forms. 3. Add 1/3
              of the paste to the medium portion of batter and 2/3 of the paste
              to the smallest portion of batter. Whisk to combine smoothly. 4.
              If using bakery emulsion, add enough so that the smallest batter
              portion is the darkest and the medium is a moderate colour. Leave
              largest batter portion plain. Bake 1. Pour batter starting with
              smallest/darkest portion, then medium, then largest/lightest
              portion. With each subsequent pour, do so quickly from a height so
              that the batter hits the bottom of the pan. Swirl just the surface
              of the batter to create a marble pattern. 2. Transfer cake pan to
              a baking tray and place in the oven. 3. Bake for 30-45 minutes. At
              30 minutes, start checking the cake. It’s done when the cake is
              puffed up, top cracked and browned. The centre should be wobbly
              but not too liquid. If not done, keep baking, checking every 5
              minutes. For a firmer texture, bake until the cake is mostly set
              but centre slightly wobbly when shaken. Cool & Serve 1. Let cake
              cool in the pan completely, at least 2 hours at room temp. 2. Once
              cooled, lift cake out with the parchment paper. Gently peel back
              the parchment and transfer cake to a serving plate. 3. Dunk a
              knife in boiling water to get clean cuts. Re-heat the knife and
              wipe clean with damp towel between each cut. 4. If desired, once
              cake is cooled, take it out of the pan, place in a sealed
              container, and refrigerate until ready to serve. Let cake come
              back to room temperature for at least 30 minutes before serving.
